# Proposal
# To be able to search number of Co-Vid 19 cases in a geographical area related to income. This will enable your business to get an idea of future outbreaks based on income. Lower income has been associated with higher Co-Vid 19 instances. If your offices are located in an area that is a hotspot than you would be able to take preventative measures to reduce loss of capital and protect your work force. I am going to join Co-Vid 19 data with IRS tax data. This will be joined on zip code. This will result in having access to number of Co-Vid 19 cases in relation to income level.
